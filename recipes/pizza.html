    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza dough is the base for most of the pizza recipes and a good start to understand the semplicity of making dough from scratch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast </li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.</li>
        <li>Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.</li>
        <li> You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but itâ€™s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
    </ol>
