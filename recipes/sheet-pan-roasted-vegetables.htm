    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roasting vegetables is an act of culinary magic. This basic process enhances and intensifies the flavors of nearly every vegetable. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 zucchini, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>8 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>16 cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 red onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl mix the zucchini, eggplant, carrots, tomatoes, onions and peppers with the oil, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, oregano, garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt and pepper. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours, and preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>On a large roasting pan, roast the vegetables, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until the tomatoes have split and the edges of some of the vegetables are starting to crisp. Remove from the oven and stir before returning to the oven for another 20 minutes. At this time reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and continue cooking until vegetables are tender, turning every 20 minutes.</li>
